Title: Tools to quantify metapopulation portfolio effects
Description: A financial portfolio metaphor is often used to describe
    how population diversity can make a group of populations more
    stable, much like how investing in a diverse set of assets makes a
    financial portfolio more stable. This package contains functions
    to estimate phenomenological ecological portfolio effects.
    Currently, the functions focus on single-species metapopulations.
